How it Works
=========================

The file is simple to execute, as far as the raw data is in the right folder. 
Just download the file onto your working directory and type run_analysis.R() would do the job.

The script is divided in 5 with respect to the 5 steps that have been assigned. 
If you would like to only check step 1, delete everything after step 1. 
Same for step 2, 3, 4 and 5.
